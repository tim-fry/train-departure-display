**A replica, near real-time, miniature UK railway station train departure sign based upon a Raspberry Pi Zero and 256x64 SPI OLED display(s). Uses the publicly available [OpenLDBWS API by National Rail Enquiries](https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/).**

## Highlights

- **See local departures**: Display the depatures from your local station at home for up to date train information.
- **3D-printable cases**: Print your own miniature case to keep everything tidy - both desktop and 'hanging' style available.
- **Dual display support**: Run two displays each showing departures from different platforms from a single Raspberry Pi.

## Credits

A big thanks to [Chris Hutchinson](https://github.com/chrishutchinson/) who originally started this project and inspired me to develop it further. [Blake](https://github.com/ghostseven) made some further improvements and this project was forked from [there](https://github.com/ghostseven/UK-Train-Departure-Display).

The fonts used were painstakingly put together by `DanielHartUK` and can be found on GitHub at https://github.com/DanielHartUK/Dot-Matrix-Typeface - A huge thanks for making that resource available!

Thanks to [@jajasilver](https://github.com/jajsilver/UK-Train-Departure-Display-NRE) and [@MatthewAscough](https://github.com/MatthewAscough/UK-Train-Departure-Display-NRE) for forming the basis of the OpenLDBWS implementation.

Thanks to [@cr3ative](https://github.com/cr3ative) and [@CalamityJames](https://github.com/CalamityJames) for the huge performance improvements and clean up in v0.5.0.
